A video game that I enjoy playing is Elden Ring. In this game you are able to chose your own class and create your own character. There are multiple weapons to use and lots of builds to try. The bosses are hard but that's what makes the game good. It has great graphics, the story is interesting, and has lots of content including dlc.

Following instructions as they are given is important when learning how to code because lots of errors can occour and you won't realize it. If steps are missing then the code will be wrong and you can make something different than what was originally planned. It is important to develop good habits because they can help you learn faster and better later on.
